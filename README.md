# net.core.authentication
A test project for working with .NET Core Authentication

# Overview

I created this project to demonstrate authentication using Google & Facebook in a generic Asp.Net Core application.

Basically, I just followed these instructions:

[Authentication in a Asp NET Core Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/social/?view=aspnetcore-2.1)

# Steps

1. Create a Core MVC project and choose __Individual User Accounts__ as the Authentication option.
